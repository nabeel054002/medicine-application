# Here lies the assumptions i have taken while building this 

- validation does mean usage 
- terms_and_conditions doesnt specify anything as in whats to be used 
- multiple types of discounts on each coupon -- charge and item

trying to implement normalization application

- major challenges is the time part, not sure what is the expected behaviour going with a simply 

- skipping out the part where in we handle applied and post transaction separately 
- so on validation itself we use it 

- its fine to have a body in a GET request
